These days, I decided to refresh my Python and algorithm knownledge. For this reason, I looked for some algorithms problems.. 
Finally, I liked one from Reddit, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/3g2tby/20150807_challenge_226_hard_kakuro_solver/">the kakuro problem</a> and this is my solution.
