I just finish to type an scrapper example. Now, it is very simple version, but it seems works fine and it include a good test coverage.

My idea is add: 
- Multithreading to downloading webs
- Adds a better data parser, to avoid noise data
- Include some  page rank alg. to give more value some webs
- Dockerize or add support for heroku:
