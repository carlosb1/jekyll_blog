Carlos B.
- Reader and surfer
- Developer and Engineer

I love coding, for this reason. Mainly, I develop my projects in Java (mature products...) or if I want to prototype something: python or C++ (I loved it, it is the most flexible language...).
For all this, my real passion is Computer Engineering, read and surf. For this reason I don't stop to learn about technologies, algorithms, frameworks, etc... Currently, my main expertise is related to two areas:  (machine learning or cloud computing).
