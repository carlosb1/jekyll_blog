Carlos B.
- Reader and surfer
- Developer and Engineer

I love coding, for this reason, I am always learning new stuff. Mainly, I develop my projects in Java (mature products...) or if I want to prototype something: python or C++ (I loved it, it is the most flexible language...).
Coding is my way to create something for the world and for this, my real passion is Computer Engineering.  If I am not thinking in some new stack, I am reading or find some new beach for surfing. Currently, my main expertise is related to two areas: machine learning or cloud computing. 

First one, It is related to  neural networks and computer vision, two subjects which I usually apply in my day by day. Second one is related to my previous experience working in R+D companies where I helped to implement a virtualization network tool.
